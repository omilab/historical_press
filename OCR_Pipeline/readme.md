## Legacy to PAGE Pipeline
The folder "OCR_Pipeline" contains a "Runner" script (PipelineRunner.py) and a test Jupyter notebook: Pipeline.ipynb.

The notebook describes the pipeline steps and includes usage samples. It includes a series of code snippets, and their expected output below.

To use the runner script or the notebook samples, import additional two python files that are also included: TkbsApiClient.py and TkbsDocument.py.

The sample_data subfolder includes data that can be used when running the notebook and the runner script.

The code was tested in Transkribus production environment.

To run totkbs, use python 2.7 and install dependencies with "pip install -r requirements.txt"

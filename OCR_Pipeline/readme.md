## Legacy to PAGE Pipeline
The folder "OCR_Pipeline" contains a "Runner" script (PipelineRunner.py) and a test Jupyter notebook: Pipeline.ipynb. 

The notebook describes the pipeline steps and includes usage samples. It includes a series of code snippets, and their expected output below.

To use the runner script or the notebook samples, import additional two python files that are also included: TkbsApiClient.py and TkbsDocument.py. 

The sample_data subfolder includes data that can be used when running the notebook and the runner script.

The code was tested in Transkribus production environment.
